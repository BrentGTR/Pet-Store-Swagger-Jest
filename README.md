## What you used to select the scenarios, what was your approach?
The approach taken in selecting the functionality to cover with the automated tests was based on a MVP of the a pet store application. 
Hence features such as create were selected as they would be the first action performed by a user when setting up the store. A login 
scenario was also selected as this feature is the first touch-point of the application for users. 


## Why are they the most important
Please see above.


## What could be the next steps to your project
Further steps are to complete the testing of the endpoints of the project as each relate to functionality of the application.
